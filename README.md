# Wind Energy Harvesting with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation regarding the work on wind energy production by means of airborne technologies and reinforcement learning.

* In the ```Dynamics``` folder you can find the 2D adn 3D dynamical models of an airborne device (kite) attached to the ground with a tether

* In the ```Learning``` folder you can find the implementation of the sarsa algorithm to perform the learning of the device

## Examples:
